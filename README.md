# HomeAutomation
Home Automation with Orange pi (server) and Esp32 controllers(clients) wboth written in python (micropython to be exact)

it will allow for a orange pi to be a server 

and allowing somewhat modular and abstract structure for the esp32(s) 
so spicialisation for a specific task to be easy or doable with a config(if desired of course)
